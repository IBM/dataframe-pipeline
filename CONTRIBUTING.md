# Contributing

This is an open source project, and we appreciate your help!

We use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/IBM/dataframe-pipeline/issues) to discuss new features and non-trivial bugs.

This project requires that you provide [DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin, Version 1.1)](https://developercertificate.org/) to make any contribution. When you want to make a contribution, please make a commit <font color="crimson">**with ```-s``` option**</font> like ```git commit . -s -m "commit message"```. The ```-s``` option appends a ```Signed-off-by``` line to your commit message like ```Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>```. If all of your commits are signed off by you, your DCO is automatically provided when you make a pull request. This automation is done by using a [DCO bot](https://github.com/probot/dco).

Note: A ```Signed-off-by``` line is needed to **every** commit in a pull request.

Generally, we expect two maintainers to review your pull request before it is approved for merging.
